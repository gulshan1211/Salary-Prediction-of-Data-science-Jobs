# Salary-Prediction-of-Data-science-Jobs
Description:
This project focuses on addressing the challenge of accurately estimating salaries for various data science roles in a rapidly expanding field. By leveraging data from Glassdoor.com, a popular job listings and reviews website, we present a novel approach to predict salaries for data science positions. Our method involves web scraping, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms.

Key Features:

Data collection from Glassdoor.com using web scraping techniques.
Comprehensive data preprocessing and feature engineering to enhance data quality.
Utilization of machine learning models including Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Tree, and Gradient Boost Regressor.
Evaluation of model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Exploration of correlations, covariances, and feature selection to optimize model accuracy.
Objective:
The primary goal is to provide a reliable method for estimating salaries for data science positions, benefiting both employers and job seekers. Our approach offers a more accurate prediction than existing methods by incorporating industry-specific insights, skills, and experience levels.

Results:
Our analysis shows that the Random Forest Tree model outperforms other models, considering non-linear relationships, handling high-dimensional data, and robustness against outliers. The project's findings contribute to the transparency of salary negotiations and market worth estimation in the data science job market.
